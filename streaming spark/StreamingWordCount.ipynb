    "In this task you're receiving batches in real time through DStream. You need to create the Wordcount program with the saving and updating of the state after each batch. \n",

    "You have to print the TOP-10 most popular words in the input dataset and its quantity. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several points for this task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) You have to print the data only at the end. The criteria is if you have received the first empty RDD, the stream is finished. At this moment you have to print the result and stop the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) You may split the line with using $flatMap$ method in DStream.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) In this task you need to filter out short words (with length less than 4). For this aim you may use $filter$ method in DStream.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Remember that you should use string lowercase. You may use $map$ method in DStream to transform words to such case.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) You may use  $reduceByKey$ in Dstream to merge the tuples with the same key by summing the word count value.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) In this task, you need to be able to maintain the state across the batches. You may use the $updateStateByKey()$ method, which provides an access to the state variable and helps you to implement the \"stateful\" approach. You can update the current state with the results of every batch.\n",

So in this moment  Spark will execute all the transformations. This will lead to container's overflow if the dataset is really big. So if you faced the error like `Container killed by YARN for exceeding memory limits`, call some action before `if` clause in this function."
